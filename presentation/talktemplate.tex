\begin{block}{Routing Problem in MANETs} 
    The challenge is to create a routing protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs) that adapts in real-time to their constantly changing network topologies, ensuring reliable communication with minimal overhead. Traditional static routing protocols are ineffective in this dynamic environment, which is where the OLSR algorithm comes into play, aiming to resolve these issues.

\frametitle{Motivation/Importance}
% \framesubtitle{``Gain upon solving the problem, pain if not solved'' should be explained}
\textbf{Essential Connectivity:} OLSR addresses the critical need for stable communication in dynamic environments like disaster recovery, military operations, and remote connectivity.

\textbf{Real-world Reflection:} The protocol models our social dynamics, where each node supports and relies on the network, highlighting our interconnected nature.

\textbf{Broad Applications:} From emergency services to smart vehicles, OLSR's efficiency is crucial for the next generation of wireless communication.

\textbf{Complex Balance:} Crafting a protocol that is both adaptive and lightweight in a constantly shifting network topology is a complex yet vital task.
\end{frame}

\section{Background/Model/Definitions/Previous Works}


\subsection{Model, Definitions}

\frame{
\frametitle{Definition of the Problem}
% \framesubtitle{Formal definition of a Stochastic Process}
The routing problem in MANETs that OLSR aims to solve involves determining the most efficient paths for data transmission between mobile nodes in a network where links frequently and unpredictably appear and disappear as nodes move.
}

\subsection{Terminology}
\begin{frame}{Terminology}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MANET: Mobile ad-hoc network with self-configuring, infrastructure-less mobile devices.
    \item MPR (Multipoint Relays): Selected nodes that reduce broadcast repetitions by relaying messages during routing.
    \item Hello Messages: Used for neighbor discovery, sent periodically by nodes to directly connected neighbors.
    \item TC (Topology Control) Messages: Broadcast by nodes through MPRs to disseminate link state information across the network.
\end{itemize}
    
\end{frame}

\subsection{Background, Previous Works}
\begin{frame}{Background}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{AODV \cite{Perkins1999}:} Reactive like DSR; uses routing tables, unlike OLSR's MPRs.
        \item \textbf{DSDV \cite{Perkins1994}:} Proactive with full-table broadcasts; OLSR reduces overhead with selective flooding.
        \item \textbf{TORA \cite{Park}:} Adapts quickly to changes with link reversal; OLSR maintains consistent network topology knowledge.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Comparison}

\noindent \textbf{AODV (Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantage:} Efficient in managing bandwidth and battery power in mobile devices.
    \item \textbf{Disadvantage:} High latency in route discovery.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{DSDV (Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantage:} Predictable performance due to regular updates.
    \item \textbf{Disadvantage:} High overhead and slow reaction to topology changes.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{TORA (Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantage:} Quickly adapts to network topology changes.
    \item \textbf{Disadvantage:} Can create loops if not managed properly.
\end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{OLSR (Optimized Link State Routing)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Advantage:} Efficient in networks where frequent route updates are not needed.
    \item \textbf{Disadvantage:} Overhead can be significant in large and highly dynamic networks.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\section{Contributions}
% \subsection{Contributions}
\begin{frame}{Contributions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Proactive Routing:} OLSR provides constant route availability, which is crucial for applications requiring immediate route access.
        \item \textbf{MultiPoint Relays (MPRs):} Reduces the overhead of message flooding by using selected nodes to forward control messages.
        \item \textbf{Optimized Routing Control:} The protocol minimizes control traffic through incremental topology updates rather than full-fledged table exchanges.
        \item \textbf{Topology Dissemination:} OLSR's efficient dissemination of topology information ensures all nodes maintain consistent network knowledge.
        \item \textbf{Scalability:} Designed to scale well in larger networks compared to many other MANET routing protocols.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\section{Design and Methods}
\subsection{Algorithm Overview}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{OLSR Algorithm Overview}

The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) algorithm involves the following key procedures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Topology Discovery:} Nodes periodically exchange "hello" messages to detect neighbors and assess link status.
    \item \textbf{MPR Selection:} Each node selects a set of neighboring nodes as MultiPoint Relays (MPRs) based on the network topology to efficiently forward messages.
    \item \textbf{Routing Table Calculation:} Nodes use topology information, primarily through MPRs, to calculate the shortest paths to all other nodes in the network.
    \item \textbf{Control Message Flooding:} MPRs disseminate Topology Control (TC) messages across the network, reducing the number of transmissions required to share topology changes.
    \item \textbf{Route Maintenance:} Nodes continuously monitor link status and adapt the network routing tables accordingly, ensuring up-to-date path availability.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Good}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Efficient and proactive routing protocol specifically designed for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs).
    \item Utilizes Multi-Point Relays (MPRs) to significantly reduce the routing overhead, enhancing scalability.
    \item Capable of adapting rapidly to dynamic network topologies, ensuring effective routing amidst frequent changes.
    \item Near optimal performance with ultra fast convergence.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Bad}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Stability issues: OLSR may face stability challenges due to incomplete knowledge of the entire network topology, occasionally resulting in sub-optimal routing paths.
    \item Performance degradation: In highly mobile scenarios, the periodic updating of routes may not keep pace with rapid topological changes, potentially degrading performance.
    \item Complexity in routing: The time complexity of MPR selection and the shortest path calculation can be high, potentially affecting performance as the network size increases.
\end{itemize}

% \framesubtitle{}
% Choose \textbf{just the key results}. They should be important, non-trivial, should give the flavour of the rest of the technical details and should be presentable in a relatively short period of time. Use figures instead of tables instead of text.

% Better to present 10\% the entire audience gets than 90\% nobody gets

% \begin{itemize}
% \item Make sure your notation is clear and consistent throughout the talk. Prepare a slide that explains the notation in detail, in case that is needed or if somebody asks.
% \item Always label all of your axes on graphs; use short but helpful captions on figures and tables. It is also very useful to have an arrow on the side which clearly shows which direction is considered better (e.g., "up is better").
% \item If you have experimental results, make sure you clearly present the experimental paradigm you used, and the details of your methods, including the number of trials, the specific analysis tools you applied, significance testing, etc.
% \item The talk should contain at least a brief discussion of the limitations and weaknesses of the presented approach or results, in addition to their strengths. This, however, should be done in an objective manner -- don't enthusiastically put down your own work.

% \end{frame}


% \subsection{Main Result 3}
% \begin{frame}
% \frametitle{Main Result 3}
% \framesubtitle{}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item If time allows, the results should be compared to the most related work in the field. You should at least prepare one slide with a summary of the related work, even if you do not get a chance to discuss it. This will be helpful if someone asks about it, and will demonstrate your mastery of the material.
% \item Spell check again.
% \item Give for each of the x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis
% \item Label, unit, scale (if log scale)

% Advices come from \cite{spillman2000present}.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item You can now make observations that would have been confusing if they were introduced earlier. Use this opportunity to refer to statements that you have made in the previous three sections and weave them into a coherent synopsis. You will regain the attention of the non- experts, who probably didn’t follow all of the Technicalities section. Leave them feeling that they have learned something nonetheless.
% \item Give Open Problems It is traditional to end with a list of open problems that arise from your paper. Mention weaknesses of your paper, possible generalizations, and indications of whether they will be fruitful or not. This way you may defuse antagonistic questions during question time.
% \item Indicate that your Talk is Over
% An acceptable way to do this is to say “Thank-you. Are there any questions?”\cite{einstein}
