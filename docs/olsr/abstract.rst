The Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol is an advanced version of the classic link state routing designed for mobile ad hoc networks. Its key feature is the use of multipoint relays (MPRs), which are special nodes chosen to forward messages. MPRs reduce the number of broadcast messages that are sent across the network, addressing the issue of high overhead seen with traditional broadcasting methods. In OLSR, only MPRs send out link state information, which cuts down on the amount of control messages moving through the network.Furthermore, MPR nodes share information selectively, focusing on their connections to the nodes that have chosen them (selectors), instead of sharing information about all links in the network. This selective reporting leads to a more efficient distribution of link state data, which is all that's needed to calculate accurate routes. OLSR is particularly good at finding the best routes with the fewest hops between nodes. The OLSR protocol is very effective in large and dense networks. In such environments, the MPR strategy really shows its value, making OLSR a strong choice for modern and future mobile wireless LANs.
